She hordes the kids out of the elevators and into the Zoo. A circular maze of hedges, rocks and other landscaping on one edge of the parc around their home hexagon. In regular intervals the walls and and rocks opened to windows into the different habitats. She was especially fond of the meerkat habitat on the right hand side just behind the entry of the zoo.  She sat down on the bench enjoying the break while her own mob of kids watched the mob of meerkats on the other side.

She checked the sign. This particular mob was broadcasted life from their current position, an undisclosed location in southern Africa. 

Of course it would have been easier to install the window in the classroom and just switch from animal to animal. But integrating the Zoological streams into the gardens of the hex combined the relaxing with the educational. The screens dubbed by many “magic mirrors” had changed Zoos forever. Animals were no longer kept in captivity. They lived in their natural habitat, and if necessary the zoo networks cameras moved along with them. The cams were scattered all over the world.
