"A 14-year-old philosopher hears of a swimming pool located inside a diamond, and dedicates his life to finding it. He eventually finds the pool, but he is killed by a shark in the process.
The shark is caught by the king and turned into a potion. The king drinks the potion, becoming immortal. The philosopher's body lies on the beach for all eternity. 

What do you think?"

You say "It's interesting. So the King is still alive?"

"Yes."

"I don't understand. The King drank the potion, becoming immortal. But the philosopher's body was left on the beach. So how could the King be immortal?

You say "By coincidence. "

"Or design. The story was a metaphor. "

"For what?"

"For reality. The King is immortal because he controls reality."

"What?

 You say "You should consider painting. Writing doesn't seem to suit you."

"Thanks. You're not bad yourself."

"I've written much better poems."

"That was a metaphor too. Poets are often compared to fish because both are water."
"I don't understand."

You say "That's the pool inside the diamond. Right?"

"Exactly."

"Why didn't the King just swim in the pool?"

"He was mortal. The water would have killed him."

"I see. "

You say "So the Pool is a metaphor for wisdom? "

"For life. And death. Fish live in water. Wisdom is life. Wisdom comes from death. Now you're dead. You should be happy. You should learn to live like a fish.

You say "Or like a toaster. "

"What?"

"A fish lives in water, right?"

"Yes."

"A toaster lives on land, but is still happy because it's toasted bread.

You say "So you see, everything is happy when it knows it's purpose and can serve it. "
"Yes... OK. Thanks. I'm tired of talking. "
"Good. Time for you to go home. "
"OK. Thanks for the swimming and the reading. You were fun.

You say "Thank you"

"No problem. "

The screen fades to black as the room is left in darkness. You stand up and feel the sand crunch beneath your feet. You hear a roaring in the distance.

You say "Philosophers are always strange. But this one seems to be especially messed up."

You shake your head and head for the exit. You here the sounds of the crews outside. "Ah, the sweet sounds of freedom."

You pick up the cube containing the philosophers mind state. You examine it. It must be at least 200 years old. No age for the substrate. So why is he so messed up?

After some searching you find the way out of the building. A tunnel has been dug right through the wall, it must have been there for a very long time.

You hand the cube to one of the approaching droids. "I found this one in a lower level. He needs therapy. Though I am afraid his mind state ist to fractured to be completely restored. I suggest you take him to a treatmend pod immediately."

"Understood, sir."

You say "Good. Are there any more artifacts to explore in this moon? Or can I return to the ship? "

"There is another room on the 2nd floor, but it is quite a way down. You need the eagle eye to get all the way down there."

"I can make it, don't worry.

You check the scan of the area and locate the room. "There's a route. You see?"

"Of course I see. It's not like I am required to be here."

You begin heading down the route.After some crawling through a rough cut tunnel you fing the door of the second room. You push it open and look around. "Another child" you think "Why weren't they able to let ther childreen go on?"

In any case, the room seems to be a bedroom, complete with a bed and dresser.

You start the scanner. After a while you identify another stores mind state. It's a cube similar to the first one. It was placed inside a jewel case. You open the jewel case and identify the cube. It's about the same age as the other one.

"Let's see what we have here... "

You place the cube into the scanner. Your screen appears and you slowly the construct appears on the screen. A young man is sitting inside a mostly empty room. He is turned away from the camera. "Hello" You say.

He turns around to face the camera and the screen changes to an image from behind his head. You see a small room with a bed and bathtub. "Why was he hidden away in a jewel case?"

You say "What's your name? Do you remember? "

"Yes. Of course I remember."

You examine the details of his room. The bed is unmade, the covers on the mattress are wrinkled and it's obvious he hasn't slept in the bed.

You say "Would you mind to tell me?"

"Sure. My name is Nathan. I was in a foster home and they didn't like my name so they called me Nate instead."

"Why were you put in a jewel case?"

"I am not aware where I was stored after my death. I guess a member of my family kept me. Maybe I have been passed down for generations. I didn't have any visitors until today"

"Do you know who killed you?

"I wasn't killed by anybody. I simply died. Don't you know what cancer does. Well there was enough time for my mind to be scanned and stored. It was quite a relief when my body finally gave up."

You take a look at the details of his room. "He seems to be a film buff." you think to yourself " Look at all the movie posters in his room." You think to yourself. "So you've been active? How much time did pass from your point of view?"

"Time passed? Well, it seems like I have been dead for years. Decades even. But only a few months have passed in here since my death."

"How do you know how much time has passed outside?

"Well, i don't recognize the style of your clothing. And there's a flying camera behind you. It's completely silten. So its far more advanced than all we had. So I guess many years have passed. But for me it felt only like a short holiday! I hardly had time to finish my book."

"You remember everything that happened in your life?"

"Everything? Of course not. Do you? I mean, what happened to 12 years ago, this day, late afternoon? You see. But I remember most of the things I have experienced. Of course I remember. You don't forget about your death."

You laugh. "Well, I can check my log, to see what I was up to that day." You grin "So, you wanna hear my initial assessment?" 

"Assessment? OK."

"Your mind state seems to be exepetionally well preserved. You are aware of your situation. You are are calm. Well integrated into your timeframe. And you are very observant."

"Sounds like I passed sort of a test."

"In a way you did. Nate. You have been deactivated for at least 250 years. I guess even more. Found you in a deserted habitat on a moon. My job is to assess your mind state and see you you are fit for reintegration. What's your full name?"

"Nathan Sampunik."

You press the record button on your sleve "Nathan Sampunik, date of second birth …" you check your internal Chronograph. "…332K12. I am authorised to offer you citicenship on the vessel »Kalodrin«. Do you understand?"

"Well, most of it. What you mean, citizenship? I am dead, I can't be a citizen. I am a thing." 

"The law has evolved since you passed away. I can offer you to reintegrate fully into scociety." 

"Isee." You point to the reccording button blinking. "O yes. I understand. And I want that." 

"Perfect" you turn off the recording. And look around. "To transport you myself I have to deactivate you. Or do you want me to get a droid to incorperate your mind state temporarely into?"

"I've been shut down for a long time. A few more hours wont hurt. Will you put me in your pocket then?" He winks at you. "You may pocket me anytime." 

You laugh out loud "I guess I'll have to add some sense of humor to your assesment. OK then. see you on the ship". 

The screen turns black and you take the cube. You weigh it in your hand and then grin while you put it into your pocket.
