  <h1>Dancing Robot</h1>
  <p><em>Tap tap tap crunch crunch</em></p>
<p>Andrew turned around and watched the scene his ears already advertised. Sam stood in the middle of a pile spilled cereals. The four year old clutched the bowl against his chest and very cautiously walked toward the kitchen desk. Andrew grinned watching the boy balance the bowl while lifting it up to the desk.</p>
<p>Sonny already charged from below the kitchen counter toward his pray. The cleaning robot followed the track of spilled cereals. Sam giggled while the bots brushed tickled his socked feed hunting for a few more crumbs.</p>
<p>Sonny turned around a few times. „Look! Sonny is dancing.“ Sam padded the bot on the top of the sensor. Sending it into a little dance of reorientation.</p>
<p>Andrew lifts the boy up on the chair and pours some milk over the corn flakes. He watches the bot that is still turning on the spot and switches between moving forward and back an few centimeters.</p>
<p>”Interesting, reorientation should have been quicker. It really looks like sonny is dancing“ Andrew thought.</p>
<p>“Sonny. Please come here, let me see your sensor“ The bot, already on the way back to his home under the counter stopped and drove back to Andrew. Waiting patiently while his owner wiped his main sensor with a tissue. ”Thank you Sonny“.</p>
<p>Strange. Squeaky clean. Andrew was puzzled. Why did Sonny ”dance“ – for lack of a better word. Well the good thing about being a robot behaviorist was, you can do your job, while sitting at the breakfast table. Bad thing was: your mind never stopped working. He watched Sonny scan the kitchen one more time and then retreat to his place. ”A job well done, I guess“ Andrew thought and grinned.</p>
<p>Sam more or less inhaled his cornflakes and rushed to the kitchen door. “We visit the lions today daddy! Come on!“ Andrew tied his sons shoe laces in the common room and sends his offspring rushing out the front door! “Have fun in school!“</p>
<p>And now back to you my little dancer. What's up with you? Andrew grabs his tablet and walks out into the court yard. “Hi Sarah! Ready for adventure?“ Sarah, tall in the middle of the kids crowding around her, flashed her warm smile. “Yeah! The Lions in Simbabwe have a new cub. The kids will love it!“ Some late comers rush from the apartments surround the count yard and join the crowd of kids being ushered into the elevator by their teacher. As the door closed suddenly the place turns from a playground filled with kids shouts into an oasis of tranquility.</p>
