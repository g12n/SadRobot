title: A lecture in machine intelligence

“￼Do you remember the time when everything was talking about the singularity?￼” she asked. “The point when artificial intelligence and human intelligence would match and machines would rise above humans quickly.￼￼ The idea was that machines would grow above their makers and ￼finally eradicate them.” She took a sip of wine. “It didn’t happen until now. And I am perfectly confident that it won’t ever happen.” She pointed a finger at me. “And do you know why?“ 

I knew better than to tell her that of course I knew why. She had drifted into professor mode and raised her voice along with her arms. She wasn’t really talking to me anymore but to the rest of the assembles audience — basically every unlucky bystander in this bar. My only job was giving keywords. So I simply raised my glass and said “you gonna tell me“. 

And so she did. “Because we humans are lousy with words. When we hear the word ‘intelligence’ and assume human intelligence and at the same time human desires, human urges and human goals. Sex, Love, greed and a struggle to feel happy, well fed and desired. But that’s wrong. When we talk about the intelligence of the systems surrounding us, we have to talk machine intelligence. You know the key to understand that?“
