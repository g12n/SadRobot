  <h1>Assessment</h1>
  <p>Elliot chooses a seat near a tree. Before starting the interface he looks up to the sky. He knows it was artificial. Sometimes he climbs up the roof of his apartment and touches it. But there was no way for his eyes to distinguish it from the real thing outside.</p>
<p>He searched his mind and guts for a moment. No. No strange feeling about that. No feeling of loss or irritation. Actually there was a feeling. A feeling of pride and achievement. Because he knew that he could take the elevator up to the ground floor and look up at the real sky only because of this artificial one.</p>
<p>About 20 years ago he was scared to shit, that we would ruin this planet for good. But somehow we managed to survive. And life was really good. Except: now we had to figure out why the vacuum cleaner was dancing.</p>
<p>„Oh well, let's go to work.“ He grabbed his pad and looked and entered the schematics of the Mind State of Silios.</p>
<p>„There we go“ he zoomed into the timeline of the last 30 minutes. „There we have some self diagnostics. A small burst of activation … let me see what you caught“</p>
