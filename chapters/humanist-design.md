## Sustainability: 

This principle prioritizes the long-term health and wellbeing of the planet and its inhabitants. It involves designing products, services, and processes that minimize their environmental impact and promote sustainable practices.

## Social responsibility and ethical considerations: 

This principle emphasizes the importance of considering the impact of design on society and the ethical implications of design decisions.

Organizations can integrate humanist design principles into their daily operations by prioritizing the needs, desires, and values of their users and customers. This can involve conducting user research to better understand the context, goals, and motivations of the people they serve, and using that information to inform the design of their products, services, and processes. Organizations can also prioritize accessibility, sustainability, and ethical considerations in their design decisions, and create user-friendly, intuitive experiences that enhance the quality of life for their users. By incorporating humanist design principles into their daily operations, organizations can create designs that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also improve the human experience and contribute to a better world.
