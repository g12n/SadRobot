title: My Sky
---

I sit back and look at the sky. White fluffy clouds pass over it. The sun is looking over the roof of my apartment building right at this moment. It's warm and cosy. I enjoy a minute of sunbathing in the warm rays. Yes. A job well done. 

OK, technically, it's not my job that's so masterfully performed. But I can't stop being proud of it. This is *my* sky. Technically, it's the ceiling of our neighborhood. Subterranean level 8 of Hexagon 12 of Redenbug City. Home sweet home. 

I could climb up on the roof of my place and touch the sky. I actually did that a few times after it was installed. The effect was uncanny. Your eyes tell you it's infinitely far away, the shadows in the yard are just right and even your skin feels the sun and the breeze. But right there you touch the surface of the panels that maintain this illusion. For a human it's indistinguishable from the real thing outside. It even mimics the conditions outside. It can even rain. Marvin spends most of his spare time to tweak settings to match conditions even better to the outside.

Many people consider our neighborhood eccentric. Why emulate the real weather outside, if the real outside is just a few seconds in one of the elevators away. Some even suspect us to be technophobes. And yes. They got a point. We border on eccentricity.

My definition of eccentric would be hexagon 8, whose levels are modeled on novels of the 19th century. Their level 8 is indeed in eternal winter. On Christmas Day around a London town square in 1843, to be precise. Complete with snowmen and Christmas tree. Although they're missing a Ebenezer Scrooge. But their weather technician could pass for one. He guards the secret of his almost perfect snow like a dragon his lair. 

Most neighborhoods are quite standard. I call them boring. A generic sky on reliable default settings. Most of them just pick a climate zone and stick to their definition of a perfectly reasonable day. A bit of rain watering the plants at night when everyone is sleeping. Eternal sunshine of the unimaginative mind. Though nighttime isnâ€™t always at synch with the other neighborhoods. Some are kept in synch with a remote community like one in Japan. Others split a three shift work day between different neighborhoods. 

Some districts skip the sky simulation completely. You could call them purists. Rooms, halls and corridors instead of city squares or community gardens. To me, they feel more like a cross between a space station and an arboretum. When I visit Stefanie, I expect her to wear a Starfleet uniform appropriate to her surroundings. Once I greeted her with a proper Vulcan greeting, all I got was a raised eyebrow in response. 

So we are in the year 2053, where people living under realistic weather conditions are considered to be curious. But people who live in an eternal Christmas are considered quite reasonable. 

I like my sky.
