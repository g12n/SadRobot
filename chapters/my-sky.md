title: My Sky
---

I lean back and look up to the sky. White fluffy clouds are drifting over it. The sun is just peeking over the roof of my home building. It is warm and comfortable. I enjoy a minute just basking in the warm rays. Yes. A job well done. 

OK, technically it isn't my job that's beeing so masterfully executed. But I can't stop beeing proud of it. This is *my* sky. Technically it the ceiling of this neighbourhod. Subterrainian level 8 of hex 10 of Redenbug City. Home sweet home. 

I could climb up on the roof and touch the sky. I actually did that a few times after it was installed. The effect was uncanny. Your eyes tell you it's infinitly far away. The shadows in the yard are just right. Even your skin feels the sun or the cold breeze of the wind. But right there you touch the surface of the panels that maintain this illusion. For a human this is indistinguishable from the real thing outside. It even mimics the conditions outside. It can even rain, although Marvin spends most of his spare time to tweak settings to match conditions even better to the outside. 

Many people consider our neighborhood eccentric. Why emulate the real weather outside, if the real outside is just a few seconds in one of the elevators away. Some even suspect us to be technophobes. And yes. They got a point. We border on eccentricity.

My definition of eccentric would be  Hex 8 with their levels modeled after 19th century novels. Their level 8 is actually in eternal winter. Christmas Day in a London  square in 1843 to be precise. Complete with snow men and Christmas tree. Although they are missing an Ebenezer Scrooge. But their weather technician could pass as one — guarding the secret of his near perfect snow like a dragon his lair. 

Most neighborhoods are quite standard. I call them boring. A generic sky on reliable default settings. Most pick a climate zone and stick to their definition of a perfectly reasonable day. Watering outside plants at night when everyone is sleeping. Eternal sunshine of a unimaginative mind. Though nighttime isn’t always at synch with the neighboring hoods. Keeping in synch with a remote community like one in Japan. Or split a three shift work day between different neighborhoods. 

Some neighborhoods even skip the sky simulation completely. One might call them purists. Rooms and corridors instead of town squares or community gardens. To me this makes their hoods feel more like space stations in sci-fi novels. Whenever I visit Stefanie I expect her to wear a star fleet uniform to match her living environment. Once I greeted her with a proper Vulcan greeting but just got an raised eyebrow as an reaction. 

So here we are in the year 2053. Where people living under realistic weather conditions are considered funny. While people people with eternal Christmas are deemed quite reasonable. 

I like my sky.
