    <h1>Sad Robot</h1>
<p>I don't consider myself a novelist. Not even a writer. But I like stories and visions of the future. Though I am quite picky and can't really find many stories that I consider to be positive Sci-Fi. Optimistic views on the fututre and technology. And maybe there isn't a market for those kind of stories. The 20th century conditioned us for a skeptic view on technology and a bleak view of the future.</p>
<p>Just to keep sane in this eternal dismal view of the work I sometimes think of nice future perspectives. Now I start dropping them into this repository. No Idea if this ever will become a coherent story or will for ever be a collection of random snippets.</p>
<p>I call this repository “sad robot” because of pub-philosophical questions that once popped into my head. What would cause my my Robot Vacuum Cleaner to be sad? I fondly call him Robbie. And yes he is male. What would I do to cheer him up. Spill an extra portion of crubs on the floor?</p>
<p>So dear visitor who just happened to stumble over these files be warned. Don't expect exiting penmenship. Read along if you like.</p>
