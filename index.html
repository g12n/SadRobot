      <h1>Sad Robot</h1>
<p>I don't consider myself a novelist. Not even really as a writer. But I do like stories and visions of the future. However, I'm pretty picky and can't really find many stories that I would consider positive sci-fi: Optimistic views of the future and technology.</p>
<p>And maybe there isn't even a market for these types of stories. The 20th century has conditioned us to a skeptical attitude towards technology and a gloomy view of the future.</p>
<p>But I am a humanist and a believer in the potential of science and technology to improve our lives and create a better future. I support the use of modern agriculture techniques, including the use of GMOs, as well as cellular agriculture and cultured meat production, to increase productivity and sustainability in food production. I also believe in the importance of science-based medicine in providing effective and safe healthcare. I believe that these approaches represent important steps forward and should be embraced and implemented in order to drive progress and improve our world for future generations. I am optimistic about the potential of science and technology to make the world a better place, and I am committed to supporting these efforts and promoting a future that is bright and full of possibilities.</p>
<p>Just to stay sane in this eternal gloomy view of work, I sometimes think about beautiful futures.</p>
<p>Hence this little page where I throw the little snippets of ideas. The time to make a book or a coherent story out of it will probably never be found.</p>
<p>I call this repository &quot;sad robot&quot; because a pubescent philosophical question once occurred to me. What would make my vacuum cleaner robot sad? I affectionately call him Robbie. And yes, he is male. What would I do to cheer him up? Spill an extra helping of mop on the floor?</p>
<p>So dear visitor who happened to stumble across these files, be warned. Don't expect an exciting pen pal relationship. Read on, if you like.</p>
