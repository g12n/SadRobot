      <h1>Sad Robot</h1>
<p>While I don't consider myself a novelist or even a writer, I do enjoy reading and thinking about stories and visions of the future. However, I find it difficult to come across stories that I would consider to be positive sci-fi, as I am looking for optimistic views of the future and technology.</p>
<p>It is possible that there is not a large market for optimistic, positive sci-fi stories. The 20th century has conditioned us to be skeptical of technology and to have a negative view of the future. While dystopian worlds often make for exciting stories, it is important to also consider and explore more positive and optimistic visions of the future. Utopian worlds can also be fascinating and thought-provoking, and it is important to consider different perspectives and possibilities for the future.</p>
<p>But I am a humanist and a believer in the potential of science and technology to improve our lives and create a better future. I support the use of modern agriculture techniques, including the use of GMOs, as well as cellular agriculture and cultured meat production, to increase productivity and sustainability in food production. I also believe in the importance of science-based medicine in providing effective and safe healthcare. I believe that these approaches represent important steps forward and should be embraced and implemented in order to drive progress and improve our world for future generations. I am optimistic about the potential of science and technology to make the world a better place, and I am committed to supporting these efforts and promoting a future that is bright and full of possibilities.</p>
<p>To maintain my sanity in the face of a bleak view of work, I often find myself thinking about beautiful and hopeful futures.</p>
<p>Hence this little page where I throw the little snippets of ideas. The time to make a book or a coherent story out of it will probably never be found.</p>
<p>I named this page &quot;sad robot&quot; because I once had a whimsical question about my vacuum cleaner robot, whom I affectionately call Robbie. I wondered what would make him sad and how I could cheer him up. Perhaps I could spill an extra helping of dirt on the floor, as it is his favorite thing to clean. This page is a reflection of my thoughts on the emotions of robots and how we might interact with them in the future.</p>
<p>So dear visitor who happened to stumble across these files, be warned. Don't expect an exciting pen pal relationship. Read on, if you like.</p>
