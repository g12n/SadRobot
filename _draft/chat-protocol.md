Subheadline: Why the West needs a new social movement for progress. 

The West is in need of a new social movement that focuses on making things cheaper. This movement would be a declaration of abundance, a statement that we have the knowledge and technology to improve the lives of people and make essential goods and services more affordable.

## continue with a paragraph focussing on modern technology used to create food and other essential goods sustainable and social

Modern technology has made it possible to produce food and other essential goods in a sustainable and socially responsible way. For example, advances in agriculture and food processing have led to more efficient and less wasteful methods of producing and distributing food. This has allowed us to feed more people using fewer resources, and has reduced the environmental impact of our food systems. Additionally, the use of renewable energy sources and sustainable materials can help to reduce the carbon footprint of essential goods, making them more environmentally friendly. By harnessing the power of technology, we can create a more abundant and sustainable future for all.




## Continue with a paragraph about the combination of automation, cellular agriculture, renewable energy as well as nuclear power. 

The combination of automation, cellular agriculture, renewable energy, and even nuclear power can help to make the production of essential goods more efficient and sustainable. Automation can reduce the need for labor, freeing up workers to focus on other tasks and improving the overall productivity of our economy. Cellular agriculture allows us to produce meat and other animal-based products without the need for traditional farming, reducing the environmental impact of our food systems. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can provide a clean and limitless source of energy for our industrial processes. And while nuclear power has its own set of challenges and risks, it can also provide a reliable source of energy without emitting greenhouse gases. By leveraging the latest technologies, we can create a more abundant and sustainable future.



## Add a historic perspective of bauhaus and early product design movement embracing industrialization to provide goods and housing for more people. 

The Bauhaus movement, which emerged in the early 20th century, embraced industrialization as a way to provide goods and housing for more people. Bauhaus designers sought to combine functionality and mass production with artistic and aesthetic considerations, creating modernist designs that were both beautiful and practical. This focus on industrialization and mass production allowed for the creation of affordable and accessible products that could be distributed to a wider audience. The Bauhaus movement laid the groundwork for many of the product design principles that are still in use today, and its influence can still be seen in the streamlined and functional designs of many modern products.
